# German-Programming-Language
The provided code introduces the concept of a simple programming language in German, aiming to bridge the language barrier and offer a coding experience to students in Germany who may not have proficiency in English. 

This code defines a basic programming language in German, intending to make coding accessible to German-speaking students. It introduces a set of instructions such as ADD, SUB, PUSH, and JUMP, which are written in German, providing a localized and beginner-friendly coding experience. The accompanying class, named "Maschine," simulates the execution of these instructions, utilizing a stack-based approach. The code includes error handling for cases like invalid instructions or infinite loops, enhancing the learning experience. A sample program is demonstrated, showcasing the execution of German-coded instructions to check for equality and stop the program. This initiative not only addresses the language barrier but also encourages students in Germany to explore the fascinating world of programming through their native language.
